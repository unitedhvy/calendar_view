/mail_vis: looking back at a year of emails on my uni account  <br> <br>

Start Date: Tue, Aug 29th <br>
Goals: Visualize frequency, size, and sent/recieve ratio of mails. Possible filtering for different keywords. <br> <br>




Walkthrough: <br> 

Data: <br>
The first step, of course, was to download my GMail mail archives through Google's account manager. This was easy enough, once the data archive was complete, Google emailed me a link to a zipped archive. After extracting, I was left with a 300mb ".mbox" mail archive that stubbornly refused to open through VS Code or Atom, but came up on TextEdit. 


Design: <br>
I figured the best way to look at my year's worth of emails would be to group them into major chunks of time. I've split them into the following: <br>
Before School | First Semester | Winter Break | Second Semester | Summer <br>
